	Linear least squares with l2 regularization.(ridge)

	Linear regression with combined L1 and L2 priors as regularizer. (ElasticNet)

	It is a Linear Model trained with an L1 prior as regularizer. (LassoLARS)


###Microsoft Paper

**No comparison kind of thing found among different classifiers, so, left it out

###Predicting Adsâ€™ Click-Through Rate with Decision Rules

```bash
	http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/dweiss/research/adrules/papers/troa.pdf
```

two problems cited: esmtimating CTR value for existing ads, predicting CTR values for new ads

in  order  to  estimate  CTR,  they  use maximum  likelihood  estimation  (MLE)  to  learn  all  model parameters directly from real historical data.

for prediciton have their own model

**doesn't again seem to be telling where each of our classifiers is good, so left out

**even data types we are using does not match with them

###Predicting Click-Through Rate Using Keyword Clusters

**I don't think we want these types of papers, there are plenty, but none satisfy our requirements of defining a domain for Linear Regression.

Get this paper (here)[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425798000844]

I'll try to get this one in college.

###Ebook : Applied Linear regression

This book cites some areas where linear regression is widely applied

##On the statistical description of inhomogeneities in the quiet solar atmosphere.

this one uses Linear Regression in some kind of geothermal prediction. And it can go into related works.
